description: Tesla's "We, Robot" event was a bit of a nothingburger to put it mildly. But its themes and evocations made me ponder, what is it that we actually want from robots?

Initial Thoughts:
-Titled "We, Robot" which seems like a bad reference to make? Last time I remembered that story
- No steering or pedals? That seems like a horrible idea, even if everyone switched over to them. Also I'm sure that makes the legal hurdles gigantic, not to mention Trump talking about banning autonomous vehicles the same night
- two-seater? Not very helpful
- Robovan? Looks pretty weird "We're going to make this"
	- carry up to 20 people or transport goods
	- Very blade-runner 2049 aesthetic
	- Says it will bring the cost down to 5-10 cents a mile?
- Keeps trashing public transportation, saying that the cost is too great/it's unsafe
- Everyone having a robotaxi is not going to change anything about our highways & roads, congestion would presumably get worse I'd think?
- Says that the robotaxi will give you your time back
- Musk is not a good presenter
- "I think this will be the biggest product of any kind, ever""I think everyone on Earth, everyone will want an Optimus buddy"
- Musk keeps talking about only taking the good parts from scifi
- Dancing Robots with Daft Punk music, of course, then What is Love playing to the dancing
- Robots are going to serve drinks at the bar (Only pouring beer of course, no cocktails yet lol)
- Get a screenshot of the robot with a cowboy hat
- Twenty robotaxis driving around a pre-planned loop does not a robotaxi make
- Connect these ideas back to Hyperloop which went nowhere
